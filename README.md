# I AM AN ARTIST, WHY DO I NEED TO KNOW HOW TO CODE??

My whole life I loved to draw but hated math. When I was applying to college, I was so happy that I won’t have any math lessons and will be working with computers only to draw digitally. It was my dream university experience, where I would do only what I like so much and don’t waste time on some “stupid calculations”. Well, I was wrong.

During this week of Creative Computing, I wanted to dedicate my research to the relationship between art and computers. I explored an experiment from 2000s where fine art students were put into the circumstances where a new method of study curriculum with intensive use of computer design programs was presented to them, and they were obligated to follow it throughout the whole year. The movement toward the use of the computer as a toll in fine arts courses in colleges and universities began in earliest in the USA in the late 1980s. Now, the role of the computer in art education has led to questioning the traditional learning of ‘basic’ skills as the technological achievement of the computer, and changing needs of employers, affect what takes place in schools, colleges, and universities in the name of art. By the end of the experiment student gave out positive feedback of using a computer on the daily art practice: they produced exciting and even revolutionary art forms, their creativity and professional skills were positively affected by good software and innovative digital art tools. Nevertheless, students did not prefer to use only digital art and still wanted to use physical tools.
